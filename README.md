# Real Estate Pricing

In this challenge, we'll go resolve a real estate pricing case. This challenge was built in partnership between Tera and [QuintoAndar](https://www.quintoandar.com.br), where the objective is to simulate a machine learning project with characteristics similar to what happens in the company's day-to-day activities.

Imagine yourself in the following situation: QuintoAndar's marketing area wants to set up a price calculator (like [this one](https://mkt.quintoandar.com.br/quanto-cobrar-de-aluguel/)), and in this project , business analysts and brokers also want to understand the main variables and key characteristics that influence the sale value of the property (e.g. quantify the impact of the increase in the property's area on the price, or quantify the impact of having a pool, or not in the price). You are the data scientist who will act to solve this case.
